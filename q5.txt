1. Does the change inside increment_int_a change the variable a after the function call?
    a. No
2. Does the change inside increment_int_b change the variable b after the function call?
    b. Yes
3. If they differ answer why? if not why not?
    c. Integer a is stored in a global variable and cannot be modified
    in function "increment_int_a". Anything variables made
    in that function are considered local and does not change the 
    global variable. On the otherhand, a data structure such as a 
    list or a dictionary can have its elements modified within functions.
